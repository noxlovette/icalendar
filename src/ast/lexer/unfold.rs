/// Unfolds RFC 5545 folded content lines.
///
/// Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
/// break. Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
/// representations using a line "folding" technique. That is, a long line
/// can be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF immediately
/// followed by a single linear white-space character (i.e., SPACE or
/// HTAB). Any sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single linear
/// white-space character is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the
/// content type.
///
/// The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation to
/// its single-line representation is called "unfolding". Unfolding is
/// accomplished by removing the CRLF and the linear white-space character
/// that immediately follows.
///
/// When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first be unfolded
/// according to the unfolding procedure described above.
///
/// # Example
///
/// > DESCRIPTION:This is a lo
/// >  ng description
/// >   that exists on a long line.
///
/// unfolds to:
///
/// > DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.
