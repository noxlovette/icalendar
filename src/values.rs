/// The form of date and time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used.  For
/// example, the following is not valid for a DATE-TIME value:
///
/// > 19980119T230000-0800       ;Invalid time format
///
/// ## FORM #1: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME
///
/// The date with local time form is simply a DATE-TIME value that
/// does not contain the UTC designator nor does it reference a time
/// zone.  For example, the following represents January 18, 1998, at
/// 11 PM:
///
/// > 19980118T230000
///
/// DATE-TIME values of this type are said to be "floating" and are
/// not bound to any time zone in particular.  They are used to
/// represent the same hour, minute, and second value regardless of
/// which time zone is currently being observed.  For example, an
/// event can be defined that indicates that an individual will be
/// busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day, no matter which time zone
/// the person is in.  In these cases, a local time can be specified.
/// The recipient of an iCalendar object with a property value
/// consisting of a local time, without any relative time zone
/// information, SHOULD interpret the value as being fixed to whatever
/// time zone the "ATTENDEE" is in at any given moment.  This means
/// that two "Attendees", in different time zones, receiving the same
/// event definition as a floating time, may be participating in the
/// event at different actual times.  Floating time SHOULD only be
/// used where that is the reasonable behavior.
///
/// In most cases, a fixed time is desired.  To properly communicate a
/// fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
/// time zone reference MUST be specified.
///
/// The use of local time in a DATE-TIME value without the "TZID"
/// property parameter is to be interpreted as floating time,
/// regardless of the existence of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components in
/// the iCalendar object.
///
/// ## FORM #2: DATE WITH UTC TIME
///
/// The date with UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN
/// CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character, the UTC designator, appended to
/// the time value.  For example, the following represents January 19,
/// 1998, at 0700 UTC:
///
/// > 19980119T070000Z
///
/// The "TZID" property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE-TIME
/// properties whose time values are specified in UTC.
/// FORM #3: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE
/// The date and local time with reference to time zone information is
/// identified by the use the "TZID" property parameter to reference
/// the appropriate time zone definition.  "TZID" is discussed in
/// detail in Section 3.2.19.  For example, the following represents
/// 2:00 A.M. in New York on January 19, 1998:
///
/// > TZID=America/New_York:19980119T020000
///
/// If, based on the definition of the referenced time zone, the local
/// time described occurs more than once (when changing from daylight
/// to standard time), the DATE-TIME value refers to the first
/// occurrence of the referenced time.  Thus, TZID=America/
/// New_York:20071104T013000 indicates November 4, 2007 at 1:30 A.M.
/// EDT (UTC-04:00).  If the local time described does not occur (when
/// changing from standard to daylight time), the DATE-TIME value is
/// interpreted using the UTC offset before the gap in local times.
/// Thus, TZID=America/New_York:20070311T023000 indicates March 11,
/// 2007 at 3:30 A.M. EDT (UTC-04:00), one hour after 1:30 A.M. EST
/// (UTC-05:00).
///
/// A time value MUST only specify the second 60 when specifying a
/// positive leap second.  For example:
///
/// > 19970630T235960Z
///
/// Implementations that do not support leap seconds SHOULD interpret
/// the second 60 as equivalent to the second 59.
///
/// Example:  The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in New
/// York City in each of the three time formats, using the "DTSTART"
/// property.
///
/// > DTSTART:19970714T133000                   ; Local time
/// > DTSTART:19970714T173000Z                  ; UTC time
/// > DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19970714T133000 ; Local date and time ; zone
